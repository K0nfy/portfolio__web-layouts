## About
Here you'll can see a few web layouts that compiled (not designed) by me for my portfolio as the beginning web-developer. 

Presentation page with links and previews: [portfolio-webpage](https://k0nfy.github.io/portfolio-webpage/build/ "Presentation page")

Layouts presented in &laquo;dev&raquo; and &laquo;build&raquo; formats. 
Difference: in the &laquo;build&raquo; format were minified all css, js and image files.

Simple and pretty. For this template I had only desktop design layout, so for the tablets and the mobiles widths I changed the details in my own way.

Stylish and pretentious. Template has a lot of intersecting background gradients. For this template I had only desktop design layout, so for the tablets and the mobiles widths I changed the details in my own way.

Complex layout, which is quite a prototype of a real online store. For this template I had only desktop design layout, so for the tablets and the mobiles widths I changed the details in my own way.
